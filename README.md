# make.home

### motivation
When new students first come to Make School, there are a lot of people they may not know yet. While for some this can be overwhelming, others may just want to jump in a meet as many people as they can. When looking up current solutions for this problem, I came across Stripe's internal tool built by a couple employees at a company hackathon called Stripe home.

#### Features of Stripe Home:
* Current employees quiz to learn names of employees using pictures
* Company calendar with events going on around the company
* Company announcements panel
* Employee spotlights

#### Features of make.home:
* Quiz to learn staff members names using pictures
* Google calendar with Make School campus events
* Make School twitter
* Admin option to add people to quiz, edit people, or delete people

#### Whats left:
* improve UI
* Add students to quiz on right side
* Have quiz include concentration as well
* Add an employee and student directory
* Add Authentication to Admin page
